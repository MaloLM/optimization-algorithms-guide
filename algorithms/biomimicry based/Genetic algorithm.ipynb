    "## What are genetic algorithms ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). It is based on natural selection to approximate soltuion(s) for a given problem. As a metaheuristic algorithm, it may not find the optimal solution but is at least fast the execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Très flexibles, utilisés à la fois pour des problèmes discrets et continus, mais fréquemment appliqués à des problèmes combinatoires.\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts with a population of possible solutions. Each solution has a genone that encodes it. It is often a binary encoding that differenciates the solution from the others. Chromosomes are encoded or by 1 or by 0. 1 [explain what means 1 or 0 in general]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all solutions at a given points is called a generation. First solutions generation is Generation 0. This starting generation is composed of random solutions that should not be optimal at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a generation is set, natural selection is processed by determining the fitness of current generation solutions and then pick parents. This is done using the fitness function, which tells how good a solution is. In the parents selection process, solutions are picked and fitness score increases chance to be picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once parents are picked, the next step is about crossoverring their genomes. A crossover function has de be defined for that and their are many approach which will be covered bellow. Crossovering parents genome creates news genomes that can be interpreted as children, which creates part of the news generation of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Children creation is repeated until a new generation is fullfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since fitness function and crossovering has part of randomness, there is a risk of killing best solutions from the previous generation. To avoid that, we implement an elitism mechanism that saves previous generation best solution and select them to the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is mutation step: during this phase, we simply mutate a few chromosomes, changing random bits with a certains probability (0->1 / 1->0). After this pahse, a new generation is finnaly ready. \n",
    "\n",
    "This generation process lasts as long as a suffisient solutions is not found or for a given number of generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take a step back, those are the main concepts of this algorithm:\n",
    "- genetic representation of solution (genomes mades of chromosomes)\n",
    "- a function to generate new solutions\n",
    "- a fitness function, evaluating solutions quality\n",
    "- a selection function, selecting solutions inside a population\n",
    "- a crossover function, making childrens out of parents genomes\n",
    "- a mutation function, altering childrens genomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The population encoding may differ from a problem to another: sometimes it not efficient to use bits, but integers lists, float  list or even graphs to solve a given problem. Same logic is true for the crossover process.\n",

    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",

    "## Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Guarantee of Optimal Solution**: GAs can converge to a suboptimal solution rather than the global optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slow Convergence**: In some cases, especially when the solution space is vast, GAs might take a long time to converge to an acceptable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parameter Setting**: Choosing appropriate parameters like mutation rate, crossover rate, and population size can be challenging and might require experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Risk of Premature Convergence**: GAs can sometimes converge prematurely to a suboptimal solution, especially if there's not enough genetic diversity in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Computationally Intensive**: Due to the nature of evolutionary processes, GAs might require a significant amount of computational resources for complex problems. If fitness determination is long, then global execution should be long too.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Overfitting**: Especially in applications like machine learning, if not managed properly, GAs might lead to solutions that are overfit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Complexity**: Implementing a GA might be more complex than simpler optimization techniques for certain problems.\n",
