    "## Understanding the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm is a mathematical method for solving linear programming problems. It was developed by George Dantzig in 1947. The basic principle of linear programming is to maximize or minimize a linear function, called the objective function, under linear constraints as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for continuous linear optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main steps of the simplex algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Formulation**: The problem is formulated in terms of an objective function to be maximized or minimized. For example, maximizing profit or minimizing cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Constraints**: The constraints of the problem are expressed as linear equations or inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feasible Basic Solution (FBS)**: An initial feasible basic solution is identified. An FBS is a solution that satisfies all the constraints and where the number of non-zero variables does not exceed the number of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimality Evaluation**: It is checked whether the current FBS maximizes (or minimizes) the objective function. If this is the case, the solution is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iteration Towards a Better Solution**: If the current solution is not optimal, the algorithm performs a pivot. This involves choosing an entry variable (to increase the value of the objective function) and an exit variable (to maintain the constraints), and then recalculating the FBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Termination**: The algorithm ends when the optimal solution is reached or when there is no better possible solution (for example, in the case of an unbounded problem)."

    "## Usage examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm is used in many situations where it is necessary to solve linear programming problems, that is, problems where one seeks to optimize (maximize or minimize) a linear function subject to linear constraints as well. Here are some typical contexts of use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Optimization**: In the industrial or production sector, for efficiently allocating limited resources (such as raw materials, machine time, or personnel) to maximize profit or productivity, or to minimize costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Planning and Scheduling**: For developing optimal schedules, whether in project management, flight scheduling in airlines, or production planning in factories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Portfolio Management in Finance**: For the optimal selection of investments or the diversification of portfolios, where the goal is to maximize expected returns while managing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logistics and Transport**: To optimize delivery routes, inventory management, or vehicle assignment, in order to reduce costs or improve logistic efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Network and Telecommunications**: For optimal management of network traffic, bandwidth allocation, or network capacity planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Food and Agricultural Optimization**: To maximize crop yields or the efficiency of diets, considering nutritional constraints or available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Operations Research and Strategic Decision Making**: In strategic decision-making for businesses or organizations, where various factors and constraints must be balanced to achieve an optimal overall objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Healthcare Sector**: For managing medical staff schedules, planning patients for various procedures, or managing hospital resources.\n",

    "## Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency for Many Problems**: Although theoretically the simplex can take exponential time, in practice, it is very efficient for many real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Guaranteed Optimal Solution**: If an optimal solution exists, the simplex will find it. It is precise and reliable in finding an optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The simplex can handle changes in the constraints or the objective function without having to start from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretable Information**: The algorithm not only provides an optimal solution but also information about the sensitivity of solutions to changes in the problem's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Wide Applicability**: It can be applied to a wide range of problems in different fields such as economics, logistics, resource management, etc.\n",

    "## Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity with Large Data Sets**: For very large-scale problems or with a large number of constraints, the simplex can become inefficient in terms of computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unbounded or Tricky Problems**: In some cases, such as unbounded problems or those with degenerate solution regions, the simplex may not perform optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lack of Efficiency in Parallelization**: Unlike other methods, the simplex algorithm is difficult to parallelize efficiently, limiting its speed on modern computer systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sensitivity to Rounding Errors**: As it relies on numerical calculations, it can be sensitive to rounding errors, especially in cases where the equations are nearly degenerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Not Universally Applicable**: The simplex only applies to linear programming problems and cannot be used for non-linear or discrete problems (such as integer programming).\n",
